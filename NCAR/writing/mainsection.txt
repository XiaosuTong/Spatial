1.1 Introduction
There are approximately 8000 stations reporting monthly average maximum daily temperatures 
at some time in this period. However, the maximum number of stations with data on any given 
month is substantially less reaching a maximum of around 6000. 

1.2 Initial Analysis: Data and Statistics

  In this section, we describe the procedures of our data collection and initial processing, 
followed by summary statistics of the obtained monthly maximum temperature. Further processing 
of the data into multiple databases of various structures are discussed in details in the 
following sections along with the corresponding analyses enabled and facilitated by each 
database.

1.2.2 Summary Statistics
  some initial plots and summary
  I will look at the data trends and show how they are cyclical in nature and show little long time trends.

About conditionally parametric

A nonparametric surface is conditionally
parametric if we can divide the factors up into two disjoint subsets
A and ? with the following property: given the values of the factors in A,
the surface is a member of a parametric class as a function of the the factors
in B. We say that the surface is conditionally parametric in A.
It makes sense to specify a regression surface to be conditionally parametric
in one or more variables if exploration of the data or a priori information
suggests that the underlying pattern of the data is globally a very smooth
function of the variables. Making such a specification when it is valid can
result in a more parsimonious fit.
An exceedingly simple modification of loess fitting yields a conditionally
parametric surface. We simply ignore the conditionally parametric factors
in computing the Euclidean distances that are used in the definition of the
neighborhood weights, Wi(x).

The method for making a loess fit conditionally parametric in a proper subset of predictors is simple.
The subset is ignored in computing the Euclidean distances that are used in the definition of the
neighborhood weights, $\omega_i(x)$. Let us use an example to explain why this produces a conditionally 
parametric surface. Suppose that there are two predictors, $\mu$ and $\nu$, and $\lambda=2$. Suppose
we specify $\mu$ to be a conditionally parametric predictor. Since the weight function ignores the 
variable $\mu$ the $i$th weight, $\omega_i(\mu, \nu)$ for the fit at $(\mu, \nu)$, is the same as the
$i$th weight, $\omega_i(\mu+t, \nu)$, for the fit at $(\mu+t, \nu)$. Thus the quadratic polynomial 
that is fitted locally for the fit at $(\mu, \nu)$ is the same as the quadratic polynomial that is 
fitted locally for the fit at $(\mu+t, \nu)$, whatever the value of $t$. So for the fixed value
of $\nu$, the surface is exactly this quadratic as a function of the first predictor.
