1.1 Introduction
There are approximately 8000 stations reporting monthly average maximum daily temperatures 
at some time in this period. However, the maximum number of stations with data on any given 
month is substantially less reaching a maximum of around 6000. 

1.2 Initial Analysis: Data and Statistics

  In this section, we describe the procedures of our data collection and initial processing, 
followed by summary statistics of the obtained monthly maximum temperature. Further processing 
of the data into multiple databases of various structures are discussed in details in the 
following sections along with the corresponding analyses enabled and facilitated by each 
database.
