#stats::model.frame
‘model.frame’ (a generic function) and its methods return a
‘data.frame’ with the variables needed to use ‘formula’ and any
‘...’ arguments.
Even though the value from model.frame is a data.frame, it has 
other multiple attributes, which can be assessed by using
attr(mf, "terms")

#storage.mode(x)
‘mode(x) <- "newmode"’ changes the ‘mode’ of object ‘x’ to ‘newmode’

#set the names of an object
setNames()

#Create the .so file
R CMD SHLIB ../shareLib/loessc.c ../shareLib/loessf.f -o myloess.so
