## Land-based Station: ##
-Quality Controlled Local Climatological Data (QCLCD)
Experiencing a quality controlled, the QCLCD data technically is from Jan 2005 to present. But 
since data from 2005 to 2007 is still under processing of quality controlled, the data is from
QCLCD200705 to QCLCD201410, and is consist of hourly, daily, and monthly summaries for 
approximately 1,600 U.S. locations. Totally 90 months. Each hourly data (for each month) is about
300Mb, and daily data is about 4Mb, and monthly data is about 200Kb. For hourly data, there are 
24 columns, such as DryBulb temperature, WetBulb temperature, DewPoints temperature, RelativeHumidity, 
Windspeed, so forth.

-Unedited Local Climatological Data (ULCD)
Unedited local data is from July 1996 to July 2007. For over 700 U.S. locations. Each hourly data
(for each month) is about 45 Mb. If we would like to study this LCD data, hourly data is more
reasonable with respect to the size, it is large. And unedited LCD can be merged to QCLCD, which
means we can have data from Junly 1996 to Oct 2014 which is 220 months. But the number of stations
is very small.

## Satellite Data: ##

-Geostationary IR Channel Brightness Temperature - GridSat B1 

## Reanalysis Data: ##

Reanalysis datasets are created by assimilating ("inputting") climate observations using the same 
climate model throughout the entire reanalysis period in order to reduce the affects of modeling 
changes on climate statistics. Observations are from many different sources including ships, 
satellites, ground stations, RAOBS, and radar.
### Key Strengths: ###
-Global data sets, consistent spatial and temporal resolution over 3 or more decades, hundreds of 
variables available; model resolution and biases have steadily improved
-Reanalyses incorporate millions of observations into a stable data assimilation system that would 
be nearly impossible for an individual to collect and analyze separately, enabling a number of 
climate processes to be studied
-Reanalysis data sets are relatively straightforward to handle from a processing standpoint 
(although file sizes can be very large)
### Key Limitations: ###
-Reanalysis data sets should not be equated with "observations" or "reality"
-The changing mix of observations, and biases in observations and models, can introduce spurious 
variability and trends into reanalysis output
-Observational constraints, and therefore reanalysis reliability, can considerably vary depending 
on the location, time period, and variable considered
